# Baby-Gender-Guide
This project was created as a fun Raksha Bandhan gift for my sister. It’s a lighthearted and interactive program that shares interesting baby-related fun facts and includes a small quiz to “predict” the baby’s gender just for entertainment. It combines creativity, logic, and a playful design to make the experience enjoyable and engaging.
